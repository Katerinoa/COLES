This code is used to support the Neurips 2021 submission: Contrastive Laplacian Eigenmaps.
In this code, we provide codes for Table 2 and node clustering experiments. To prevent unnecessary trouble, we submit the data along with the code.
For reddits and ogb-arxiv, we do not provide the code because the corresponding is too big.
The usage is like
python train_ssgc_(dataset_name).py
python train_ssgc_(dataset_name)_clustering.py

We also provide the log file for checking to avoid if the code cannot run correctly in some unknown situations.
